# Tamagotchi-Dinosaurs-Public

The game first starts with asking the user if they would like to see the rules.

If you would like to see the rules, as it is your first time playing, you simply press y, which then displays the rules.

Defensive programming is used to ensure the game would not bug out regardless of user input.

You can then choose the number of dinosaurs you would like to create - the more you create the harder it is, as there is more to manage!

You then have the option to load your previous save file, the user can choose to use their previous dinosaurs, or start fresh.

You may now choose which dinosaur to play with, this pick doesnt matter much initially, however it does matter later on in the game or if you load your previous dinosaurs.

We can now choose to feed/calm or see the score of our dinosaur.

The base stats of your dinosaur are as follows:

We will first choose to calm the dinosaur - which will increase the calm score, however our dinosaur gets passively hungry so its hunger score is decreased 
(lower score means more hungry)!

We can now view the changes in our dinosaur by checking the score:

There is also a "danger" option, which allows you to see which dinosaurs need the most attention so you may tend to them. We can see that the game displays what type of care
the dinosaurs need, in our case Bob needs the most calming.

Now we need to switch to Bob, so we stop playing with Rob, and we start tending to Bob's needs instead.

Alternatively, we can stop the game, and exit - giving us the option if we want to save or not.
